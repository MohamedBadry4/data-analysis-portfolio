# 📊 Fintech Performance & Customer Loyalty – Storytelling Insights

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the **operational health and customer lifecycle** of the platform to identify:

* **Financial Performance**: Where revenue is generated and where it is being lost.
* **Operational Friction**: Bottlenecks in the transaction process (Cancellations/Refunds).
* **Customer Retention**: Identifying loyalty trends and segments at risk of churning.

The analysis focuses on **Total Sales (GTV), Transaction Completion Rates, Regional Performance, and RFM Segmentation**.

## 1️⃣ Growth & Market Scale (The "Big Picture")

### Key Findings:

* **Customer Base**: 500 Active Customers.
* **Total Sales (GTV)**: **$10.13M** generated from **20,000 transactions**.
* **Service Distribution**: All services (**Ride-hailing, Food Delivery, Bill Pay, Grocery, Mobile Recharge**) are used nearly equally, showing a balanced product ecosystem.
* **Top Regions**:
* **Cairo** (The Profit Leader)
* **Alexandria & Luxor** (High Volume Hubs)



### Insight:

> The business successfully scaled its revenue to over $10M with a diverse service offering that appeals equally to all customer needs across Egypt's major cities.

## 2️⃣ The Completion Crisis (Operational Red Flag)

### Key Findings:

* **Overall Completion Rate**: Only **33.21%**.
* **The Breakdown**:
* **1/3** of transactions are **Completed**.
* **1/3** of transactions are **Cancelled**.
* **1/3** of transactions are **Refunded**.



### Insight:

> This is a **Major Red Flag**. For every successful dollar earned, two dollars are "leaked" through cancellations or refunds. This indicates severe operational friction, likely due to merchant reliability or technical issues.

## 3️⃣ Time Series Analysis – The Growth Crash

### Key Findings:

* **The Golden Peak (H1 2024)**: Explosive customer growth in the first two quarters of 2024.
* **The Stagnation (Q3 2024 – Q1 2025)**: Customer growth plateaued. We stopped acquiring new users and relied on the same pool of customers for 9 months.
* **The Crash (Q2 2025)**: Both **sales performance** and **customer activity** took a massive dive.
* **Retention Warning**: "Last-timers" (customers making their final transaction) began to spike in Q1 2025, predicting the crash.

### Insight:

> The business stopped growing long before the revenue dropped. The stagnation in late 2024 was a "silent warning" that the platform was losing its appeal or failing to solve user pain points.

## 4️⃣ RFM Segment Crisis (Who is Leaving?)

### Key Findings:

* **The "Hibernating" Problem**: Our largest customer segment is now **Hibernating** (Long-time users who have stopped using the app).
* **At-Risk Segment**: **13.20%** of our customers are currently categorized as **"At Risk"**—they are loyal spenders who haven't made a transaction recently.
* **Segment Profitability**: High-value segments like **Gold** and **Premium** are the ones dropping off the fastest.

### Insight:

> We are losing our most valuable users. The "Hibernating" segment represents a massive "Ghost Town" of potential revenue that has moved to competitors.

# 💡 Strategic Insights Summary

* **Revenue is high ($10M)**, but the foundation is unstable due to a **66% failure rate** (Cancellations + Refunds).
* **Service demand is healthy** and uniform across categories, meaning the "Product" is good, but the "Execution" is failing.
* **Growth stalled in late 2024**, leading to a direct revenue crash in **Q2 2025**.
* **Customer Loyalty is at a breaking point**, with nearly 1 in 7 customers standing at the exit door (At Risk).

# 🎯 Recommendations

### For Operations:

* **Fix the 33% Completion Rate**: Investigate the top 5 merchants with the highest cancellation rates and remove them from the platform.
* **Refund Deep-Dive**: Analyze why **1/3** of orders are being refunded. Is it late delivery or poor product quality?

### For Marketing & CRM:

* **Operation "Wake Up"**: Launch a targeted "Welcome Back" campaign for the **Hibernating** segment with high-value, limited-time promos.
* **The "At-Risk" Intervention**: Reach out to the **13.20% At-Risk** customers with a survey or a loyalty reward to prevent them from churning.
* **Regional Focus**: Re-invest in **Cairo and Alexandria** to stabilize the core profit centers before attempting to expand into new cities.

## 🏁 Final Storytelling Message

> The data tells a story of a business that grew too fast and forgot to fix its "Leaky Bucket." While the $10M revenue is impressive, the high cancellation rates and stagnating growth have led to a critical turning point. By focusing on **Retention over Acquisition** and fixing the **33% Success Rate**, the platform can turn its "Hibernating" users back into "Champions."
